## Project Description:
This project is a microservice which I have created to allow users to view details about trails around the world. Each trail also has a number of features, which consists of things such as whether dogs are
allowed or if the trail is child friendly. Using the database, both trails and features can be created, retrieved, updated and deleted, and features can also be linked to trails through a trail feature link
entity.
